# Simple Mandelbrots set

# What is it?

## Fractal 

A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.

## Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set puts some geometry into the fundamental observation above. Here is its precise definition:

The Mandelbrot set consists of all of those (complex) c-values for which the corresponding orbit of 0 under x2 + c does not escape to infinity.
x1 = x02 + c

# Usage

1. Clone this repo

2. Install the requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run
`python main.py`

You can set height and width of frame like: `python main.py --height=768 --widht=1024`


Also you can run `simple_mandelbrot.py`, written with matplotlib, just for see what is Mandelbrot set.
